# Pure Storage PowerShell Toolkit 2.8.0.430

### History
I started the PowerShell Toolkit in 2015 when Pure Storage introduced REST API 1.0. Coming from Microsoft and NetApp the first thing I wanted to work on was a PowerShell Module. I was doing custom scripting based on a small library of cmdlets I first built. As more customization requests came in I decided to build the module. It was a few months of weekends and sushi and netted the start of the Pure Storage PowerShell SDK binary module. 

Version 2.8.0.430  of the Toolkit is provided here as an example of how to use the Pure Storage REST API 1.x with Windows PowerShell. It serves as a historical reference for how Pure Storage started our integration work with Windows PowerShell.
